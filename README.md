# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaFX. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to form a line of three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If no player achieves a winning line and the grid is filled, the game is considered a draw.

## How to Play
- Launch the game.
- The grid will be displayed with nine buttons representing the cells.
- Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their symbol.
- The game will automatically determine if a player has won or if the game is a draw.
- To restart the game, click the "Restart" button.
