# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaFX. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to form a line of three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If no player achieves a winning line and the grid is filled, the game is considered a draw.

How to Play
Launch the game.
The grid will be displayed with nine buttons representing the cells.
Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their symbol.
The game will automatically determine if a player has won or if the game is a draw.
To restart the game, click the "Restart" button.
