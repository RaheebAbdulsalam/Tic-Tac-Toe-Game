# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaFX. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to form a line of three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If no player achieves a winning line and the grid is filled, the game is considered a draw.
